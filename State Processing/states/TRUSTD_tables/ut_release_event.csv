1446,645,5.0,2013-01-18,"to Diane (NN)-  I'm sending this email in follow-up to the last two USEPA-NNEPA conference calls regarding LUST sites within the Navajo Nation.  During those calls, I explained my understanding of the status of the former Garnenez Trading Post (NAV-444).  Based on my file review, there is no solid evidence that USTs ever existed at this site.  The USEPA Region 9 memo-to-file dated 7/26/04 (included in the attachment below) indicates that highway widening in 1975 may have removed any previous UST or AST systems.  In addition, the same USEPA memo refers to a 1976 Tribal Resolution banning future oil and gas sales at this site.  When Arthur Boone (formerly with USEPA) visited the site in 2000, he was informed that only ASTs had been used at the site, or that any previous USTs had been floated out during flooding of the San Juan River.

iina ba's October 2008 Geophysical Investigation Report noted that no USTs were identified during the geophysical survey and, as such, recommended &quot;no further action&quot; (see attachment).  USEPA Region 9 originally considered this a &quot;suspected release&quot; site.  However, based on the information discussed above, USEPA has removed this site from its LUST universe.  If hydrocarbon contamination is discovered at this site in the future, USEPA may reopen the file.  Please contact me with an questions.

2796,991,3.0,2016-09-01,"Excerpted from EPA's Technical memo that accompanied the NFA letter.  In September 2016, Oneida Nation completed additional work including razing of the buildings on both sites (Hilltop/Appletons and Mike and Diane's) and excavation of approximately 1,500 tons of petroleum impacted soil (383 tons of petroleum from the Mike & Diane’s Tavern site). The excavated soil was removed from the area of the former UST systems located on the northern portion of the sites. The contaminated soil was disposed of at the Outagamie County Landfill.  [Date of 9/1/2016 is used by September 2016 was noted in our documentation.]",SKAMKE,2020-08-26 14:44:59,,,RP/Tribe/State Lead (no TF),,,,
