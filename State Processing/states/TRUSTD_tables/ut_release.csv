Western Pump investigated on 4/3 and replaced the shear valve on 4/4.  After replacing the shear valve on the 91 product line, the dispenser was not receiving any 91 product.  The 91 MLLD was not tripped and all other dispensers were functioning as normal.  Contractor determined there was a leak somewhere under the 11/12 dispenser.  The Travel Center turned off the 91 STP and discontinued dispensing 91 and 89 fuel to the entire station.
